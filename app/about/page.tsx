            The chimera, in Greek mythology, is a creature composed of parts
            from different animals, often embodying a fantastical amalgamation
            of features. The chimera is depicted as a fire-breathing monster
            with the body of a lion, the head of a goat protruding from its
            back, and a serpent for a tail. chi·mae·ra [kahy-meer-uh] Just as
            the chimera embodies a fusion of different animal parts, STEM
            represents a mix of distinct disciplines, each contributing its
            unique strengths to create something new and impactful. This
            interdisciplinary approach fosters innovation, driving progress
            across a wide range of fields, from medicine to space exploration,
            echoing the mythical chimera&apos;s ability to transcend the
            boundaries of individual creatures. We celebrate this ideology in
            IEEE Ashoka and hope to showcase it at Chimera 2024!
